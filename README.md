# SMS-Spam-Detection
I have created a project on SMS Spam Detection in Machine Learning using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python language to check whether the sms is spam or not.
In this project I have used many libraries such as pandas,sklearn, seaborn, etc, and even I have checked the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and support for
three different classifiers namely Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.From which I came to know that the Random Forest classifier is the best 
and suitable approach for this model.
